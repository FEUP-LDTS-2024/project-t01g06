-> You are in control of a squad of 3 soldiers:
    -> The player is represented by a 'P', and your allies by an 'A';
    -> Your death represents the end of the game;
    -> Your enemies are represented by red 'E's.

-> The order of the turns is player-allies-enemies;

-> Each turn is split into two phases:
    -> Movement phase: use the arrow keys to move your characters;
    -> Combat phase:
        -> use the right and left arrows to choose your target and ENTER to select;


->There is a total of three levels, before victory is reached and any losses you
suffer between levels are permanent and will not be replenished. Despite this,
any of your characters that survive will have their stats buffed each round.


-> In game, there are five important stats that will be displayed on the left side
of the screen:
    -> HP
    -> Damage
    -> Aim
    -> Real Aim/Damage


-> On the battlefield there will be series of obstacles ('S', 'W', 'B') that will
affect yours and your enemies' damage and chances to hit.


-> Last but not least, there are also three different power ups to make you
stronger (Extra Health: '+', Extra Damage: '>', Extra Aim: 'o').
