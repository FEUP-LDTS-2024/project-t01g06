-> In this game, you take control of a squad of 3 soldiers:
    -> You (the player) are represented by the 'P' character, and your allies by 'A';
    -> Your death represents the end of the game, while your allies' deaths are "irrelevant";
    -> Your enemies are represented by red 'E's.

-> The order of the turns is player-allies-enemies;

-> Each turn is split into two phases:
    -> Movement phase: use the arrow keys to move your characters, you can also press 'Q' to abandon the match and
    return to the menu;
    -> Combat phase:
        -> use the right and left arrows to choose your target (marked with a 'T');
        -> press Enter to select the target.

-> There is a total of three levels, before victory is reached, each one with an increasing number of enemies
in each, despite this, any losses you suffer between levels are permanent and will not be replenished. Plus, any of your
characters that survive will have their stats buffed.

-> In game, there are five important stats that will be displayed on the left side of the screen:
    -> HP: represents the total health of the active and target characters, when it reaches 0, the character is
    considered dead;
    -> Damage: represents the damage dealt by each hit shot on the target;
    -> Aim: represents the chance each shot has to hit the target and is affected by distance and cover;
    -> Real Aim/Damage: similar to the ones referred above, but represent the real values when all modifiers are applied.

-> On the battlefield there will be series of obstacles:
    -> Small Stone Wall 'S': reduces the incoming damage by 10 and the enemy aim by 30;
    -> Small Wooden Wall 'W': reduces the incoming damage by 5 and the enemy aim by 20;
    -> Bush 'B': reduces the enemy aim by 10;

    You need to be adjacent to them (8 blocks around you) and the obstacle needs to be between the origin and the target
    to take effect (flanking is a valid tactic to negate this effects).

-> Last but not least, there are also three different power ups to make you stronger:
    -> Health '+': increases your HP by 20 points;
    -> Aim 'o': increases your aim by 10 points;
    -> Damage '>': increases your damage by 5 points;

Make good use of this information and have fun on the battlefield.
