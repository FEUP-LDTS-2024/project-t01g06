-> You are in control of a squad of 3 soldiers:
    -> You (the player) are represented by the 'P' character, and your allies by 'A';
    -> Your death represents the end of the game, while your allies' deaths are "irrelevant";
    -> Your enemies are represented by red 'E's.

-> This game is turn based with each turn being split into three phases:
    -> Movement phase: use the arrow keys to move your characters;
    -> Combat phase:
        -> use the right and left arrows to choose your target (marked with a 'T');
        -> press enter to select the target
